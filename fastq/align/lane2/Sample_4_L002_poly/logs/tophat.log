	format:		 fastq
	quality scale:	 phred33 (default)
[2013-09-22 00:13:53] Preparing reads
	 left reads: min. length=35, max. length=39, 12980574 kept reads (102 discarded)
Warning: you have only one segment per read.
	If the read length is greater than or equal to 45bp,
	we strongly recommend that you decrease --segment-length to about half the read length because TopHat will work better with multiple segments
