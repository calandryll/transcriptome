	format:		 fastq

[2014-03-25 08:11:17] Preparing reads
	 left reads: min. length=39, max. length=39, 24685435 kept reads (0 discarded)
Warning: you have only one segment per read.
	If the read length is greater than or equal to 45bp,
	we strongly recommend that you decrease --segment-length to about half the read length because TopHat will work better with multiple segments
