[2013-10-01 07:24:30] Preparing reads
	 left reads: min. length=39, max. length=39, 28940366 kept reads (3653 discarded)
Warning: you have only one segment per read.
	If the read length is greater than or equal to 45bp,
	we strongly recommend that you decrease --segment-length to about half the read length because TopHat will work better with multiple segments
