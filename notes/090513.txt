Sequences
	Renamed from [Sample #]_[Adapter]_[Lane #]_R1_001.fastq to [Sample #]_[Lane #].fastq

Sequence_count.txt
	Number of sequences per fastq file and check that quality and sequences lines are equal, as determined by using seq_count.sh

Quality trimming
	Carried out using cutadapt.
	Examination of the first several sequences, does not show adapter sequences
	If they are encoded as ascii(phred quality + 64), you currently have to add 31 to the cutoff. For example, if you actually mean "-q 10", you have to write "-q 41". (From cutadapt README)
	A phred score of 20 and 30 will be used to examine differences
	quality_trimmer.py will be used, log files of cutadapt output will be saved
