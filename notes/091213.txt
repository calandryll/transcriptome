==========

Index will be built using bowtie2-build
	1. bowtie2-build H_akashiwo.fasta (previously named High_exp.fasta)
		a. not possible to build off a gff file
	2. both -p 4 and -p 8 will be tried
		a. this sets the number of threads used by the CPU. Default is 1.
			i. Default ~18s for Sample_1 (~77,000 sequences) (different index)
			ii. -p 4 ~11s for Sample_1
			iii. -p 8 ~12s for Sample_1
		b. A -p 4 will be used, seems to be a slight increase in time, with a larger sequence #
			this time difference may decrease computational time

Execution of TopHat
	1. Run ref_align.py
		a. Using the H_akashiwo index (built as above)
		b. Each sample will be run separately and store in separate directories

Execution of Cufflinks
	1. Run assemble.py
		a. Basic options for running
		b. As above
