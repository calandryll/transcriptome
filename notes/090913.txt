Created index.html for simple examination of fastqc files.

Sample lanes will be kept separate during the process.  Different lanes are currently technical/machine replicates
	to prevent errors in statistics, samples will be kept separate.  This is an excellent way to examine the
	difference between lanes.

Trying fastx_toolkit to examine differences:
Adding -Q 32 to any of the fastx_toolkit will allow running of the fastq files.  Will try using
	those commands to examine differences between fastx_toolkit and cutadapt.

	1. Run fastx_cut.py (removes adapters)
		a. Based on misc/Illumina_adapters.txt and associated barcodes with each sample
		b. _clipped indicates sequences in file have had adapter removed
		c. verbose command was copied to .log file
	2. Run fastx_trim.py (removes low quality bp)
		a. Remove any basepair below a Phred score of 20 and keep those sequences above 90%
		b. _trimmed indicates clipped sequences have been quality trimmed
		c. verboase was used to copy information to .log file
	3. Run fastx_collapse.py (collapses duplicates into singles)
		a. _collapsed indicated collapsed sequences from trimmed files
	4. Run fastx_stats.py (quality stats)
		a. text files generated can be analyzed using galaxy (Simple Fool's Guide)
		b. -N is not recognized by galaxy or the downloaded script from fastx_toolkit
	5. Run fastqc_reports.py 
		a. on trimmed data from fastx_toolkit to compare to cutadapt

Examination of the output from fastqc, the first 13 bases seem to be quite variable.  Removal of the them will be carried out using fastx_trimmer.

	1. Run fastx_shorten.py
		a. removes the first 13 basepairs
		b. _shorten from the trimmed sequences of cutadapt
	2. Run fastqc_reports.py
		a. on shortened sequences
