========

Combined samples were QC using fastx_clipper, using quality_control2.py
	1. Adapters, only ones indicated by their barcode were removed, sequences <51 bases were discarded
		a. with cutadapt it is possible to remove the other adapters in the sequences themselves
	2. The first 13 bases were trimmed using fastx_trimmer
	3. Samples were then aligned to 091313 Filtered set from Kathy (Named H_akashiwo)
		a. She sent a newer more recent QC file 092913 that will be run as well to compare between the two reference files
		b. After comparison of different trimming factors, samples will be aligned and run against newer file
	4.  ref_align.py was run on fastx_ samples. 
		a. A comparison between different trimming factors will be examined
	
Filtered_092913 was renamed to H_akashiwo and run for ref_align, etc.  fastx will be the first used since galaxy seems to favor that method for QC
