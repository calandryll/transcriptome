=========

cutadapt -b will only search the ends of the sequences.  Therefore the time spent processing them was wasted.  Files were deleted.

	1. poly_cut.py
		a. modified to use fastx_clipper to remove both poly-a and poly-t, unfortunately needs to be run twice
			i. -l 20 was used to drop any sequence less than 20 bp in length
		b. _temp file is removed since both are needed to be removed
		c. _temp.log records the number of sequences dropped from poly-a removal
		c. fastqc will be run to examine changes
	2. Removed samples created by fastx_toolkit method
		a. using fastx_clipper, etc. cutadapt appears to give cleaner results
