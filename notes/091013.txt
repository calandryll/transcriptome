Examination of the K-Mer graphs, from fastqc output, there seems to be a large poly-a and poly-t sequences.

	1. Run poly_cut.py
		a. cutadapt with poly-a and t sequences to be trimmed
		b. --times=x, where x is the number of multiple sequences you want to run
			i. default running with multiple adapters will ignore any after the best one is found
				addtion of times will run all of the adapters.
		c. _poly created from shortened samples

Support for removal of the first 13 bases: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2896536/
Increasing kmer selection can be done to 10, which may change things: http://pathogenomics.bham.ac.uk/blog/2013/04/adaptor-trim-or-die-experiences-with-nextera-libraries/
	1. fastqc -k 10 fastqfile1
Trimmomatic (http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic) will also be tried on samples to examine the effect on kmers
	1. SLIDINGWINDOW 5:20 (5 bases long:Phred 20)
	2. A test run on Sample_2_L001_shorten.fastq removes all the sequences, probably not a worthwhile venture
