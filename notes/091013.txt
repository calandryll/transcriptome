Examination of the K-Mer graphs, from fastqc output, there seems to be a large poly-a and poly-t sequences.

	1. Run poly_cut.py
		a. cutadapt with poly-a and t sequences to be trimmed
		b. --times=x, where x is the number of multiple sequences you want to run
			i. default running with multiple adapters will ignore any after the best one is found
				addtion of times will run all of the adapters.
		c. _poly created from shortened samples
