========

Reference sequences will be clustered to remove highly similar sequences and any other possible artifacts
	Command: usearch7 -cluster_fast Trinity_ref.fasta -id 0.9 -consout Trinity_cluster.fasta -uc clusters.uc

Cluster files were cleaned up removing centroid= and ;seqs=#;

There are several smaller contigs ~40bp in length in both SOAP files.  These will not be tested for DE analysis

DE Analysis
===========

Trinity_cluster and IDBA_cluster will be used as reference genomes for analysis and comparison
	bowtie2-build *_cluster.fasta H_akashiwo

--segment-length 18 was added to tophat command to remove Warning: you have only one segment per read.
	It may be beneficial to re-run analysis with Kathy's fasta as a reference with this new setting
